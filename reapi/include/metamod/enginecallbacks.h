// This file is a wrapper around the SDK's enginecallback.h file. We need
// this because we use a different type for the global object g_engfuncs,
// which is still compatible with the enginefuncs_t that the SDK
// uses.
// This is only done for files that belong to Metamod, not other projects
// like plugins that use this file, or others that include it, too.
// Since we don't have a clean seperation of include files right now we
// "hack" our way around that by using a flag METAMOD_CORE which is set 
// when compiling Metamod proper.

#ifdef METAMOD_CORE
#  include "meta_eiface.h"        // HL_enginefuncs_t

// Use a #define to bend the enginefuncs_t type to our HL_enginefuncs_t
// type instead as we now use that for the global object g_engfuncs.
#  define enginefuncs_t HL_enginefuncs_t

// Also, create some additional macros for engine callback functions, which
// weren't in SDK dlls/enginecallbacks.h but probably should have been.
